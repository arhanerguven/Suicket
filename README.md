# Suicket | Sui Blockchain Hackathon EPFL 2024

The repository for **Suicket** project in the 2024 EPFL Sui Blockchain Hackathon. Suicket is a decentralized NFT-based ticketing platform. Suicket allows event organizers to issue NFT-based tickets for concerts, conferences, festivals and anything you can imagine! 

The NFTs will serve as a proof that the ticket is bought from the event organizer. This approach prevents black market sales as Sui's blockchain ensures that tickets can be securely transferred, verified and traced. Ownership rights are immutably coded into the NFT, preventing fraud and illegal resales. 

Suicket will also assign a special and unique NFT for the event attendees that will serve the purpose of a digital souvenir. This souvenir will remind the crowd to remember one of the best experiences they had, and also attract collectors as a limited item. 

## Details
